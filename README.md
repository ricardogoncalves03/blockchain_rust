# Rust Blockchain

A simple blockchain implementation in Rust, demonstrating the basic principles of blockchain technology including creating blocks, implementing a Proof of Work system, and ensuring chain integrity.

## Features

- **Block Creation**: Create individual blocks containing data, timestamp, nonce, and hashes.
- **Proof of Work**: Implement a basic Proof of Work (PoW) system to secure block creation.
- **Blockchain Integrity**: Validate the integrity of the blockchain with hash-based linkages between blocks.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust programming environment
- Cargo, Rust's package manager


## Usage

After running the project, it will create a simple blockchain, add a few blocks, and display them along with their validity status.
